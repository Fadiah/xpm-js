## xpm

The **x**Pack **p**ackage **m**anager command line tool.

## xPacks overview

**xPacks** are general purpose software C/C++ packages, intended to enhance code sharing and reusing during the development of C/C++ libraries and applications, much the same as **npm modules** do so nicely in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Purpose

The main purpose of the `xpm` tool is to install xPacks, including all dependent xPacks, and to easily update them when new versions are released.

For developers, `xpm` provides a very convenient way of publishing the software packages, using the same central repository as `npm`.

## Easy install

If this is your first encounter with `npm`, you need to install the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) JavScript run-time. The process is straighforward and does not polute the system locations significantly; just pick the current version, download the package suitable for your platform and install it as usual. The result is a binary program called `node` that can be used to execute JavScript code from the terminal, and a link called `npm`, pointing to the `npm-cli.js` script, which is part of the node module that implements the npm functionality. On Windows, it is recommended to first install the [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) package.

With `npm` already available, installing `xpm` is quite easy:

```
$ npm install xpm -g
```
